# Hospital-system-V1-console

Brief description of the hospital system project :

-The system has 20 different specializations, each with a queue of 5 available spots. 
-When a patient arrives, they must specify their specialization and their status (regular or urgent).
-If the queue for the specified specialization is full, the patient is not added to the queue and is instead given an apology.
-If the patient is regular, they are added to the end of the queue. If the patient is urgent, they are added to the front of the queue.
-The system can print a list of all patients who are waiting for a doctor in a particular specialization.
-When a doctor arrives to pick up a patient, they must specify the specialization of the patient they are picking up.
-If there are no patients waiting in the queue for the specified specialization, the doctor is informed that there are no patients available.
-Otherwise, the doctor is able to remove the patient from the queue and take them to see the doctor.

Here are some additional details that may be helpful:

-The system can be implemented using a variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, or C++.
-The system would need to store data about the patients, such as their name, specialization, status, and position in the queue.
-The system would need to be able to keep track of the number of patients in each queue and ensure that no queue ever exceeds 5 patients.
-The system would need to be able to print a list of all patients in a queue, as well as the name of the doctor who is picking up a patient.
